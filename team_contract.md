A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through the development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed **BEFORE** starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records. This document is more for your group than it is for me, so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

## Project Team Name:

### A. Team Structure:

1. **Leadership structure**:
	Leader rotates weekly, specify rotation here.
2. **Decision-making policy** (by consensus? by majority vote? how will tie votes be handled?):
3. **Who is the team Recorder/Documentation Manager/Maintainer of all required turn-ins?**
4. **Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:**
5. **Usual method of communication** (e.g., email, cell phone, chat, in person):

| Team Member Name | E-Mail | Telephone/Other Contact Info |
|------------------|--------|------------------------------|
|                  |        |                              |
|                  |        |                              |
|                  |        |                              |
|                  |        |                              |
|                  |        |                              |


### B. Team Procedures:

1. **Method for setting and following meeting agendas** (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting?):
2. **Method of record keeping** (Who will be responsible for recording and disseminating minutes? How and when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas and minutes be stored?):
3. **Procedures in the absence of a team member** (will the team meet with one member absent, or must all members be present?):

### C. Team Participation:

1. **Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:**
2. **Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members** (team maintenance):
3. **Strategies for keeping on task** (task maintenance):

### D. Personal Accountability:

1. **Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:**
2. **Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:**
3. **Expected level of communication with other team members:**
4. **Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.**

### E. Consequences of breach of contract:

What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here: 1.) No Peer Evaluation or 2.) Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.

1. **Peer Evaluation**: 
	Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project. Discuss group norms for handling peer evaluations and state them here. 

### F. Changes to contract:
You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your initial agreement.
