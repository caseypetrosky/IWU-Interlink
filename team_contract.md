A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through the development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed **BEFORE** starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records. This document is more for your group than it is for me, so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

3. **Strategies for keeping on task** (task maintenance):
	Peer accountability.

### D. Personal Accountability:

1. **Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:**
	Attend all meetings unless communicated ahead of time, and actively participate in team meetings, describing what you have accomplished and what you're still working on.
2. **Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:**
	Complete assign tasks on time but if nescessary communicate ahead of time if you're struggling to meet a deadline and how the team can help.
3. **Expected level of communication with other team members:**
	Any set backs or changes in timeline, must be communicated to the team as soon as possible. Otherwise, check in with the team regularly to provide updates on your progress.
4. **Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.**
	Stay committed to team decisions and tasks, even if you disagree with them. Voice any concerns during team meetings, but once a decision is made, stick with it, barring any major issues not previously discussed.

### E. Consequences of breach of contract:

What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here: 1.) No Peer Evaluation or 2.) Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.
	If its a recurring issue and the group has already mentioned it to the person then it will count as points of. But the person must be aware that they have been given multiple warnings before points off on the 	peer evaluation

1. **Peer Evaluation**: 
	Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project. Discuss group norms for handling peer evaluations and state them here. 

### F. Changes to contract:
You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your initial agreement.
